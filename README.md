# React Native Web - Native Animated Module

This is a boilerplate project to work on creating a native module for animated in the browsers. There aren't really native modules for react-native-web, but it would be great if we could implement the NativeAnimatedModule interface in the browser, so we can make the animations run in the GPU just by adding `useNativeDriver: true` in our animations.
